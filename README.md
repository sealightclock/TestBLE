# TestBLE
Use this Android Studio project to learn more about BLE API.

Starting point:
- Kotlin
- Jetpack Compose
- libs.versions.toml

Features:
- Accompanist permissions library.
- BLE API

Notes:
- Use a smartphone to test the code, as the emulator does not support BLE scan.
- It looks like Jetpack Compose is very suitable for the single-Activity architecture: no need for multiple Activities or single Activity with multiple Fragments.
